### About my file
This is a program for my STEM 103 Final Project. It is a simple Python Script that acts as a budget tracker for the user.
When thinking of a project idea, I thought of making something that would be useful for my personal use. Recently I have
become a more budget-oriented person and more conscious about my personal expenses. I wanted the program to help me keep
myself on track financially and to hold myself accountable.

The script provides users with many options all pertaining to budgeting and expense tracking. It utilizes the 50/30/20 budgeting
guideline, where 50% of the user's income goes to necessities, 30% to the user's wants, and the final 20% to the user's savings or
debt repayment. 

The first couple of options allow the user to log their income each month, and based on the income they provide, the
script will calculate the respective budget categories for the user. The user is then able to view this breakdown whenever they wish.
The other options pertain to the logging of a user's expenses, where the user can keep track of individual purchases/expenses for a particular month.
The script also allows users to view how much of their budget has been utilized for a particular month based on that month's budget and the expenses.

All data is stored in corresponding CSV files so data persists across each run of the program. Eventually, I would like to learn about database usage.

The program is currently a terminal-based program, but I have intentions to make it an app or provide a GUI in the future.
The main flow of the program is a text-based menu where users can input an integer which then takes them through the option
that they choose. I had planned to implement a visual analysis of the user's budget and expense data for the final project deliverable, but to minimize
program scope and to meet the deadline, I decided to omit this element.

### Dependencies
The script requires the **prettytable** python package to run properly. Please run the command below to install prettytable.
```
pip install prettytable
```
